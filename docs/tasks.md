## Implementation Details for Priority Tasks

### Fix ConsumedUserServiceClient Security Issues

1. **Remove the insecureContext() method entirely**
   - Delete the entire method from ConsumedUserServiceClient.java
   - This method creates an insecure SSL context that accepts all certificates without validation

2. **Add proper timeout configuration to HTTP client**
   - In the initClientMann() method, replace the current HTTP client initialization with one that includes timeouts
   - Add both connect and read timeouts (e.g., 10 seconds for connect, 30 seconds for read)

3. **Fix OAuth token acquisition error handling**
   - Replace @SneakyThrows annotation with proper try-catch blocks
   - Add validation to check if the access_token field exists in the response
   - Add proper logging for authentication failures
   - Handle different HTTP status codes appropriately

### Improve Error Handling

1. **Replace @SneakyThrows with proper exception handling**
   - In ConsumedUserService.makeRequestToUserService(), add try-catch blocks for:
     - IOException (for parsing errors)
     - InterruptedException (for interrupted requests)
     - General Exception (as a fallback)
   - Make sure to restore the interrupted status when catching InterruptedException
   - Add appropriate logging for each exception type

2. **Add meaningful error messages and logging**
   - Log the HTTP status code when a non-200 response is received
   - Include relevant context in log messages (e.g., service URI, user ID)
   - Use appropriate log levels (WARNING for non-critical issues, SEVERE for critical failures)

3. **Implement retry mechanism for transient failures**
   - Add a configurable retry count for HTTP requests
   - Implement exponential backoff between retries
   - Only retry for specific error conditions (e.g., 5xx errors, connection timeouts)

### Enhance Integration Tests

1. **Improve tests for event listener functionality**
   - Create a test that simulates the IDENTITY_PROVIDER_FIRST_LOGIN event
   - Verify that the user is updated with the expected attributes
   - Mock the external service to return predictable responses

2. **Add tests for OAuth token acquisition**
   - Create tests for both successful and failed OAuth token requests
   - Verify proper handling of different response status codes
   - Test token refresh functionality

3. **Add tests for error scenarios**
   - Test behavior when the external service is unavailable
   - Test handling of malformed responses
   - Verify proper logging of errors
